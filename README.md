# Simple and light weight Flex Grid
This is a simple and light weight grid using flexbox that weights only 4kb (not gzipped, just minified!). The usage is similar to Bootstrap, and the SASS-code makes the grid easy to customize. Enjoy!

This grid ships with **no fallback** for browsers who don't support flex-box, but it does have prefixes for older browsers. [Check current browser support at CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox).
